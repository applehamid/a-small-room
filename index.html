      <h3> A small room </h2>
      <p>You enter a dimly lit room. There is only a table with a small candle and
        three glass vials containing shimmering liquids. The only door in the room
        is the one you entered through.<br><br>

        You approach the table and see a small sign beckoning you to choose one
        liquid to drink. You take a closer look at the vials.<br><br>

        The first is red and smoky, the second like liquid gold, and the third
        is an inky black.
