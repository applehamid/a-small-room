          <h2> A small room </h2>
          <p>You enter a dimly lit room. There is only a table with a small candle and<br>
          three glass vials containing shimmering liquids. The only door in the room<br>
          is the one you entered through.

          <p>You approach the table and see a small sign beckoning you to choose one<br>
          liquid to drink. You take a closer look at the vials.</p>

          <p>The first is red and smoky, the second like liquid gold, and the third<br>
          is an inky black.</p>

        <p>The grumbling is louder than ever as you set eyes on a large stone formation that <br>appears to be moving slightly.</p>
